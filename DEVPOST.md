## Inspiration
The name Veritas comes from the Roman goddess of truth. I wanted to build an extension that tackles identifying misinformation in all shapes and forms and shows the truth. I took inspiration from Grammarly, the Grammar checking tool that many people have come to love. However, instead of grammar, my tool tackles media information. I specifically chose this thinking that it's a tool that could be highly effective for the people I care about and myself.
